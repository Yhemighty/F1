<h1>Prototypes</h1>
<p>
    Prior to the sale of the first McLaren F1s, five prototypes were built, carrying the numbers XP1
    through XP5. These cars carried minor subtle differences between each other as well as between the production road cars.
    Contrary to common misunderstanding, XP1, the first ever running prototype, was never publicly unveiled. The XP1 was never painted 
    (with a bare carbon fibre exterior) and was later destroyed in an accident in Namibia. The car unveiled at the
    Monaco 1992 event was actually a "Clinic Model", aesthetically convincing but without a powertrain.
    XP2 was used for crash testing (sporting a blue colour during the test) and also destroyed. As it was a crash test car, 
    it didn't have full interior equipment or a powertrain. XP3 did durability testing, XP4 stress tested the gearbox system 
    and XP5 was a publicity car. The XP3 used to be owned by Gordon Murray before being sold to a private buyer.
    XP4 was seen by viewers of Top Gear when reviewed by Tiff Needell 
    in the mid-1990s and later on sold to a private owner, while XP5 went on to be used in McLaren's 
    famous top speed run and is still owned by McLaren.

<h1>Ameritech</h1>
<p>Seven McLaren F1s were imported by Ameritech and modified in order to be federalized for road use in the United States. These 
    modifications include the deletion of side seats, the replacement of headlights, a heightened bumper and dampened performance 
    figures including handling and braking compared to the European F1, due to road legality issues. It weighs in at 1,288.2 kg (2,840 lb).
</p>
<h1>Performance</h1>
<p>
    Performance figures are lower than a regular F1 in all aspects (apart from 0-30 mph (0-48 km/h)) relating to performance
    As Mario Andretti noted in a top speed comparison test after hitting the rev limiter at 217.7 mph
    (350.4 km/h) on Ameritech F1, the Ameritech F1 is fully capable of pulling a seventh gear, thus with a higher gear ratio
    or a seventh gear the car would probably be able to reach an even greater top speed.
</p>
<h1>F1 LM</h1>
<p>The McLaren F1 LM (LM for Le Mans) is a series of five special cars which were built in honour of the five McLaren 
    F1 GTRs which finished the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, including the winning car.
</p>
<p>The weight was reduced by approximately 76 kg (167.6 lb) to a total of 1,062 kg (2,341 lb) achieved by having no interior noise suppression, 
    no audio system, a stripped-down base interior, no fan-assisted ground effect and no dynamic rear wing.
    The car also had a different transaxle, 
    various aerodynamic modifications, specially designed 18 in (457.2 mm) magnesium alloy wheels and an upgraded gearbox.
    The F1 LM used the same engine as the 1995 F1 GTR, but without race-mandated restrictors, to produce 500 kW (671 hp; 680 PS).
    It had a top speed of 225 mph (362 km/h), which is less than the standard version because of added aerodynamic drag, despite identical gear ratios.
    In the place of the small dynamic rear wing there is a considerably larger, fixed CFRP rear wing mounted on the back of the vehicle.
</p>
<p>The LM has the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Peak torque of 705 N⋅m (520 lbf⋅ft) at 4,500 rpm</li>
    <li>Peak power of 500 kW (671 hp; 680 PS) at 7,800 rpm</li>
    <li>A redline at 8,500 rpm</li>
    <li>Total weight of 1,062 kg (2,341 lb) which gives the car an 82.15 kW (110 hp; 112 PS) per litre ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    While McLaren has never claimed specific acceleration figures for the LM, Motor Trend recorded traction-limited times of 0-60 mph in 3.9 seconds
    and 0-100 mph in 6.7 seconds. The LM was once the holder of the 0-100-0 mph record, which it completed in 11.5 seconds when driven by Andy Wallace at the disused
    airbase RAF Alconbury in Cambridgeshire.
</p>
<p>
    The F1 LMs can be identified by their Papaya Orange paint. They were painted in this colour in memory of, and tribute to,
    Bruce McLaren, whose race colour was Papaya Orange. Two of the chassis were painted in Black with Grey trim similar to the Ueno Clinic
    sponsored Le Mans 24 Hours winning car. These cars were bought by the Sultan of Brunei and, as such, also feature horizontal stripes down the sides in yellow, red and blue.
    Although only five F1 LMs were sold, a sixth chassis exists in the form of XP1 LM, the prototype for modifications to the existing F1 to form the new F1 LM.
    This car is also painted Papaya Orange and is retained by McLaren.

<h1>F1 GT</h1>
<p>
    The final and rarest incarnation of the road car, the F1 GT was meant as a
    homologation special. With increased competition from homologated sports cars from Porsche and Mercedes-Benz in the former BPR Global GT Series 
    and the new FIA GT Championship, McLaren required extensive modification to the F1 GTR in order to remain competitive. 
    These modifications were so vast that McLaren would be required to build a production road-legal car on which the new race cars would be based.
</p>
<p>
    The F1 GT featured the same extended rear bodywork as the GTRs for increased
    downforce and reduced drag yet lacked the rear wing that had been seen on the F1 LM.
    The downforce generated by the longer tail was found to be sufficient to not require the wing.
    The front end was also similar to the racing car, with extra louvers and the wheel arches widened to fit larger wheels.
    The interior was modified, and a racing steering wheel was included in place of the standard unit.
</p>
<p>
    The F1 GTs were built from standard F1 road car chassis, retaining their production numbers.
    The developmental prototype GT, known as XPGT, was F1 chassis #056XP, was painted dark green 
    ("Silverstone green") and is owned by a private collector in Switzerland. 
    The company technically only needed to build one car and did not even have to sell it.
    However, demand from customers drove McLaren to build two production versions that were sold;
    the customer F1 GTs were chassis #054 and #058. #054 was painted black and is owned by the
    Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, while #058 was painted burgundy and is owned by the ZAZ Museum in Japan.
    It weighs 1,120 kg (2,469 lb), 20 kg (44 lb) 
    lighter than the standard F1 and has a top speed of over 240 mph (386 km/h), although this was never tested.
